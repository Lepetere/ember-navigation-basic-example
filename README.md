This is an example ember app with a basic hierarchical navigation to navigate between sites. There is a top menu displayed in all sites, and a submenu depending on the type of the site. I implemented this because it was hard to find any examples doing this simple task.

To start the application, simply download or `git clone` this repository and open the file `index.html` with a web browser.

I blogged about this [here](http://www.peterfessel.com/2014/08/ember-basic-navigation-with-nested-templates-example/). A live demo of this example you can find [here](http://projects.peterfessel.com/ember-navigation-basic-example/).
